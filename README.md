# SQL Practice On Topics
1. Basic SQL Syntax:
SQL keywords
Data types
Operators
SQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

2. Data Definition Language (DDL):
CREATE TABLE
ALTER TABLE
DROP TABLE
Truncate table

3. Data Manipulation Language (DML):
SELECT statement (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING, JOINs)
INSERT statement
UPDATE statement
DELETE statement

4. Aggregate Functions:
SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX
GROUP BY clause
HAVING clause

5. Data Constraints:
Primary Key
Foreign Key
Unique
NOT NULL
CHECK

6. Joins:
INNER JOIN
LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
FULL OUTER JOIN
Self Join - Pending
Cross Join - pending

7. Subqueries:
Types of subqueries (scalar, column, row, table)
Nested subqueries â€“ Subquery within subquery, subquery will execute first and result will used to execute outer query.
Correlated subqueries - A correlated subquery is a subquery that refers to a column from a table in the outer query. The subquery is executed once for each row processed by the outer query. Executes for each row, less efficient for large dataset.

8. Advanced SQL Functions:
String functions (CONCAT, LENGTH, SUBSTRING, REPLACE, UPPER, LOWER)
Date and time functions (DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, DATEPART, DATEADD)
Numeric functions (ROUND, CEILING, FLOOR, ABS, MOD)
Conditional functions (CASE, COALESCE, NULLIF)
